                <p class="iebARE">Makkah is the holiest city for Muslims. It embraces Masjid Al Haram (the GreatMosque)
                    and
                    Kaaba, the qiblah for Muslims to which they turn in their prayers. Muslims yearn to visit Makkah to
                    perform Hajj or Umrah. In this city, Prophet Muhammad, the most honorable of creation, the seal of
                    the
                    prophets and messengers, our master Muhammad, peace be upon him, was born, and from it, the tolerant
                    message of Islam was launched to all corners of the world after the Holy Quran was revealed.

                    Makkah is located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of the kings of Saudi
                    Arabia, it
                    received great interest. Makkah still enjoys great attentionto provide the best services to
                    pilgrims.
                    Its most prominent landmark, Masjid Al Haram, witnessed many expansions that included all parts of
                    the
                    mosque, and the holy sites received a series of development works to provide all means of comfort
                    and
                    reassurance for all pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom.</p>
