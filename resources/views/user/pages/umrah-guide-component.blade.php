                        <h5>THE MEANING OF UMRAH:</h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="infotxt">The&nbsp;Umrah&nbsp;is an&nbsp;Islamic
                        pilgrimage&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mecca&nbsp;(Hijaz)&nbsp;Saudi Arabia, performed
                        by&nbsp;Muslims&nbsp;that
                        can be undertaken at any time of the year, in contrast to the&nbsp;Hajj&nbsp;which has specific
                        dates according to the&nbsp;Islamic lunar calendar.</div>

                        <h5>TYPES OF UMRAH:</h5>
                    </div>
                    <div class="infotxt">
                        A certain type of the Umrah exists depending on whether or not the pilgrim wishes to perform
                        Umrah
                        in the Hajj period, thus combining their merit.<br>
                        <br>
                        When performed alongside the Hajj, Umrah is deemed one of “enjoyment” (Umrat al-tamattu) and is
                        part
                        of a fuller Hajj of enjoyment (Hajjul tamattu). More precisely, the rituals of the Umrah are
                        performed first, and then the Hajj rituals are performed.<br>
                        <br>
                        Otherwise, when performed without continuing to perform Hajj, the Umrah is considered a “single”
                        Umrah (Umrah Mufradah).

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A sacred state (of mind and body) into which a Muslim enters before performing Hajj or
                            ’Umrah.</strong></li>
                    <li>Cleaning your body (removing hair, clipping nails, trimming moustache, taking a shower) is
                        recommended. This can be done before flying.</li>
                    <li>Wear your Ihram clothes before arriving at the Miqat</li>
                    <li>For men, this is two sheets of white clothing material.</li>
                    <li>For ladies, ordinary humble clothing will suffice.</li>
                    <li>It is recommended to put on the Ihram at the air terminal before flight.</li>
                    <li>Make your intention to perform Umrah.&nbsp;<strong>(Niyyah)</strong></li>
                    <li>Say&nbsp;Allahumma labbayka ’Umrah&nbsp;</li>

                </ul>
                <br>
                If you forget to enter into Ihram at the Miqat , you &nbsp;must either exit Makkah and re-enter it, or
                sacrifice a sheep as a penalty.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Miqat:</strong>&nbsp;it is a location outside of Makkah where Ihram will begin.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Mawaqit:</strong>&nbsp;Fixed Times and Places For Ihram<br>
                <br>
                Ibn 'Abbas (RAA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) specified for the people of Madinah,
                DhulHulaifah
                (a place 540 km to the north of Makkah) as miqat. For those coming from ash-Sham (including Syria,
                Jordan
                and Palestine), he specified al-Juhfah (a place 187 km to the north-west of Makkah and close to Rabigh,
                where they now perform their Ihram). For those coming from Najd, he specified Qran al-Manazil, (a
                mountain,
                94 km to the east of Makkah, overlooking 'Arafah. For those coming from Yemen, he specified Yalamlam (a
                mountain 54 km to the south of Makkah. These places are for the people (coming from the above specified
                countries) as well as for others, who pass by them on their way to perform Hajj or ’Umrah. Those living
                within those boundaries can assume Ihram from where they set out (for the journey), and even the
                residents
                of Makkah, their Miqat would be the place where they are staying in Makkah.’ Agreed upon.

                <br>
                Men should wear their Ihrams so that their right shoulder is bare. Men need to cover their shoulder

                    <li>Move from the Black Stone to the Yamaani corner. Do not touch any other part of the Ka’bah. You
                        may
                        make any du’a you choose.</li>
                    <li>Once at the Yamaani corner, you can touch it if you are close enough.</li>
                    <li>Continue with your tawaf, circling back towards the Black Stone.</li>
                    <li>Your first tawaf ends where you began, at the Black Stone. Now continue into your second tawaf,

                        repeat the same steps.</li>
                    <li>You must circle the Ka’bah seven times for your whole Tawaf to be complete.</li>
                    <li>For the first three tawafs,&nbsp;men only&nbsp;should slowly jog. This is called&nbsp;Ramal.
                    </li>
                    <li>Women must walk normally in all seven tawafs. Men should walk normally in the last four tawafs.

                        stand directly in front of it - it will be far too crowded. Anywhere in Al-Masjid Al-Haram is
                        fine,

                    <li>Pray two rakats. It is recommended to recite Surah Kafiroon in the first rakat and Surah Ikhlas
                        in
                        the second rakat (after Surah Fatihah, of course).</li>

                which means rapidly walking seven times back and forth between the hills of&nbsp;Safa and Marwah. This
                is a
                re-enactment of Hajar's frantic search for water. The baby Ismael cried and hit the ground with his foot
                (the story say that an&nbsp;angel&nbsp;scraped his foot or the tip of his wing along the ground), and
                water

                    <li>You must make seven rounds between the hills of Safa and Marwah. Walking from Safa to Marwa is
                        counted as one round, and Marwah to Safa as another round.</li>
                    <li>Men only&nbsp;must run part of the way. This area is clearly marked by green tubelights.</li>
                    <li>At the top of each hill,&nbsp;recite&nbsp;the du’a&nbsp;(similar to the Eid takbeer)&nbsp;three
                        times. You can make personal du’as after this.</li>
                    <li>And that’s it! Sa’ee is completed after seven rounds, so you will end at Marwah.</li>

                Taqsir is a partial shortening of the hair typically reserved for women who cut a minimum of one inch or
                more of their hair. A halq is a complete&nbsp;shave of the head, usually performed on men. Both of these
                signify the submission of will to God over glorifying physical appearances. The head shaving/cutting is
                reserved until the end of Umrah.<br>
                <br>
                These rituals complete the Umrah.<br>

                The peak times of pilgrimage are the days before, during and after the Hajj and during the last ten days
