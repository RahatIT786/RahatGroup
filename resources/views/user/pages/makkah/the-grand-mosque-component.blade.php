            <p class="iebARE">Makkah is the holiest city for Muslims. It embraces Masjid Al Haram (the GreatMosque) and
                Kaaba, the qiblah for Muslims to which they turn in their prayers. Muslims yearn to visit Makkah to
                perform Hajj or Umrah. In this city, Prophet Muhammad, the most honorable of creation, the seal of the
                prophets and messengers, our master Muhammad, peace be upon him, was born, and from it, the tolerant
                message of Islam was launched to all corners of the world after the Holy Quran was revealed. Makkah is
                located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of the kings of Saudi Arabia, it received
                great interest. Makkah still enjoys great attentionto provide the best services to pilgrims. Its most
                prominent landmark, Masjid Al Haram, witnessed many expansions that included all parts of the mosque,
                and the holy sites received a series of development works to provide all means of comfort and
                reassurance for all pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom.</p>

                                                    of the Grand Mosque were commenced in 1375 AH. The Grand Mosque was
                                                    further expanded in 1409 and in 1428AH.</p>

                                                <p>The Ka'bah is the Sacred House of Allah, and the greatest building
                                                    for Muslims. It enjoys a great prestige and a glorious history. It
                                                    was built by Abraham and his son, Ismail, peace be upon both of
                                                    them.</p>
                                                <p>It is the first house that Allah placed on earth so that mankind may
                                                    worship Him alone, without ascribing any partner to Him. The
                                                    Almighty says, "The first House (of Prayer) established for mankind
                                                    is the one at Bakkah: a blessed place and a guidance for the
                                                    worlds." It is the qiblah of Muslims and the thrust of their hearts.
                                                    It is the only structure which they circumambulate in worship to
