                millions of Muslims around the world. It is the first capital of Islam in history, and the second
                holiest place for Muslims after Makkah al-Mukarramah. Madina is located in Hejaz Region in the west of
                the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It has the Noble Prophet’s Mosque, which was built by the Prophet himself
                in the first year after Hijrah (622 AD.). It is one of the largest mosques in the world after the Holy
                Mosque. Millions of Muslims around the world visit Madina every year.</p>

                                                        was later renamed "Al-Munakhah" because coming pilgrims stopped
                                                        there for a short time. It was restored recently, so it is now
