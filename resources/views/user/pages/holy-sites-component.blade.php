            <p class="iebARE">Makkah is the holiest city for Muslims. It embraces Masjid Al Haram (the GreatMosque) and
                Kaaba, the qiblah for Muslims to which they turn in their prayers. Muslims yearn to visit Makkah to
                perform Hajj or Umrah. In this city, Prophet Muhammad, the most honorable of creation, the seal of the
                prophets and messengers, our master Muhammad, peace be upon him, was born, and from it, the tolerant
                message of Islam was launched to all corners of the world after the Holy Quran was revealed. Makkah is
                located in the western part of Saudi Arabia. During the reign of the kings of Saudi Arabia, it received
                great interest. Makkah still enjoys great attentionto provide the best services to pilgrims. Its most
                prominent landmark, Masjid Al Haram, witnessed many expansions that included all parts of the mosque,
                and the holy sites received a series of development works to provide all means of comfort and
                reassurance for all pilgrims from inside and outside the Kingdom.</p>

                                                            One of the stages of the pilgrim’s journey. It occurs on the
                                                            ninth day of Dhu al-Hijjah, where pilgrims stand at Arafah.
                                                            The Prophet, may peace and prayers be upon him, said: (Hajj
                                                            is Arafah). That is why it is called the Greatest Day of
                                                            Hajj.
                                                            Standing at Arafah and supplication anywhere within the

                                                            On the day of Arafah, pilgrims join and shorten zuhr prayer
                                                            and asr prayer. The prayer has a sermon as the Prophet, may
                                                            peace and prayers be upon him, did as he performed Hajj,
                                                            delivered a sermon, and led Muslims in his last farewell

                                                            after the sunset.
                                                            The day of Arafah has great virtues, as the Prophet, may
                                                            peace and prayers be upon him, said that the day of Arafah
                                                            is the best day for Allah.</p>

                                                            One of the most prominent landmarks of Mina is the Jamarat
                                                            or the Jamrah Pillars that are thrown at the Jamarat Bridge.
                                                            The three Jamarat are located in Mina Valley. Currently,
                                                            they are within the Jamarat Bridge, which is one of the
                                                            great achievements of the Kingdom’s Government, in order to
                                                            organize crowds and provide safety when they go to throw
                                                            Jamarat. At the beginning of the Day of Nahr, only the seven
                                                            pebbles of the biggest Jamrah are thrown. During the days of
                                                            Tashreeq, each Jamrah is thrown at with seven pebbles, from
                                                            the Smallest Jamrah, the Middle Jamrah, and finally the
                                                            Biggest Jamrah. A pilgrim can throw Jamarat from any floor
                                                            of the Jamarat Bridge. It is very important for pilgrims to
                                                            abide by the schedule of Tafweej (Group Dispatching) set by
                                                            the organizers for throwing Jamarat and the directions of
                                                            movement, in order to maintain the safety and security of
                                                            others. The Jamarat Bridge is one of the pioneering projects
                                                            that has made a civilizational and engineering leap in the
                                                            service of pilgrims. The Jamarat Facility consists of four
                                                            floors, in addition to the ground floor. It is 80 meters
                                                            wide and has 12 entrances for Jamarat and 12 exits in the
                                                            four directions, which reduces overcrowding. The Bridge is
                                                            linked to the pilgrim camps.</p>
